        "David Sacks covers a range of topics in his conversation, including his belief that VCs should have operating and founder experience to offer valuable advice to startups, the winner-take-all nature of the Hollywood industry, and Todd Phillips' decision to waive his fee for the movie Joker in exchange for equity. He also discusses the potential downsides of labor unions, stating that while he supports their advocacy for better working conditions and healthcare, they can become a source of inflexibility and deadweight loss for the union itself. Sacks believes that unions were necessary in the early 1900s when American industry was owned by an oligopoly, but now that industries are more competitive, unions may not be as necessary."
