        "Ryan Peterson discusses the significant impact of the blockage in the Suez Canal on global trade. With approximately 30% of all ocean container traffic passing through the canal, primarily from Asia to Europe, the blockage has resulted in a 20-25% reduction in shipping capacity and an additional 20-25% longer journey. Despite this disruption, Peterson believes that the Suez Canal is too crucial to remain disrupted for an extended period. He also highlights the potential consequences on shipping prices and emphasizes the canal's importance for China and Europe. Furthermore, Peterson raises concerns about the fragility of the global logistics infrastructure and the potential for the conflict to extend to global markets. Lastly, he mentions the potential impact on air freight prices if the blockage persists."
