            "Graham Allison, a national security expert and professor, is welcomed to the stage. He is known for his work on US national security, nuclear weapons, and terrorism. He has served in various government positions and is highly regarded for his expertise in decision-making during times of crisis. His book, \"Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides' Trap?\", explores the theory that when one great power threatens to displace another, war is likely to occur. This theory has been observed throughout history, from the Peloponnesian War to World War I, and now poses a potential threat in the US-China relationship."

            "The speaker discusses the concept of the \"Thucydides trap,\" which refers to the likelihood of war when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling power. They argue that China's rise as a global power poses a significant challenge to the United States, and historically, such rivalries have often resulted in war. However, they also emphasize the importance of strategic imagination and the possibility of avoiding war through diplomatic efforts and creative solutions. While they believe that war between the US and China in the near future is unlikely, they express concern about the long-term trajectory if both countries continue on their current paths."

            "In the past three decades, there has been a strong collaboration between China, the West, and specifically America. This collaboration has led to significant advancements, such as the iPhone and the reduction of poverty in China. However, recently something has gone terribly wrong, and it has happened rapidly since the COVID pandemic. This sudden change has caught everyone by surprise. The user wants to know what exactly has gone wrong and why it has happened so quickly. Additionally, they are curious about what China wants that we don't seem to comprehend."

            "China's rise in power has caused a shift in the global dynamic, challenging the US's position as the dominant superpower. China's GDP has grown significantly, and it is expected to surpass the US in the near future. This change in power dynamics has led to a change in perception and psychology, with the US feeling threatened by China's rise. China wants to be respected as its own entity, not as an honorary member of the West. The US's decision to admit China to the WTO in the late 90s was seen as a win-win situation at the time, but the full extent of China's economic growth was not anticipated. China's aspirations are rooted in its historical dominance and desire to return to its position as the center of the universe."

However, the assistant disagrees and explains that the last war between the US and China occurred in 1950 during the Korean War. The assistant emphasizes that wars often happen unexpectedly and without intention from either party. The assistant suggests that a potential trigger for a future war could be a situation involving Taiwan."

In terms of rivalry with China, India has been growing faster in recent years, but the long-term outcome is uncertain. The US believes that a democratic system will perform better than an autocracy like China. The US is forming alliances with countries like India, Australia, Japan, and South Korea to counter China's influence. There is hope that India, along with other democratic nations, can contribute to innovation and freedom. Autocracies like China have weaknesses in the long run. However, the future is uncertain and there are challenges to overcome."

The speaker acknowledges that the US claims to be an exceptional nation that makes the rules, but often does not follow them. They mention that the US has made mistakes with unnecessary wars, such as the invasion of Iraq and the occupation of Afghanistan. They argue that these wars were the result of wrong ideas dominating over right ideas, and emphasize the need for more people with the right ideas to be involved in discussions. The speaker also mentions the significance of 9/11 and the actions taken to prevent further terrorist attacks. However, they criticize the US reaction to 9/11, particularly the invasion of Iraq and the prolonged presence in Afghanistan. They suggest that the US foreign policy establishment became deranged and lacked meaningful debates. The speaker agrees that the invasion of Iraq was a terrible mistake and highlights the lack of opposition from policy elites. They also discuss the influence of the military-industrial complex and its potential role in shaping justifications for wars. While the speaker acknowledges the complexity of the situation, they do not dismiss the idea entirely."
