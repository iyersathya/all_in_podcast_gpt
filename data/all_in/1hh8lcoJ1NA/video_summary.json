He then opened coffee shops with his family in Minneapolis. After the 2016 election, he decided to run for Congress, despite his district not having been won by a Democrat since 1958. Despite skepticism, he won by 12 points using invitation and conversation rather than confrontation. He believes in letting people share their thoughts and wants to ensure that everyone has the same opportunities he had.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, the Dean observed a systemic segregation strategy between the two parties. He witnessed legal corruption, where special interests could donate to members of Congress and then have business in front of them the next day. To combat this, the Dean befriended Republican colleagues, joined the Problem Solvers Caucus, and focused on bipartisan collaboration. As for President Biden, the Dean respects him but believes he is in cognitive decline and may not be able to continue leading the country in the future. The Dean also believes that the current generation of politicians is too focused on the past and not capable of creating policies for the future. He plans to build a team of rivals and implement zero-based budgeting to save money. The Dean has faced pushback from the Democratic Party for speaking out about Biden's cognitive decline, but he believes it is necessary to address the concerns of the American people.\n\nThe video transcript discusses the experiences of the Dean in Congress, including witnessing legal corruption and the Dean's thoughts on Biden's mental state.

The main concern is the out of control spending, with the US facing a fiscal emergency due to the growing debt. The debt is projected to reach $47 trillion by 2033, with a significant portion being refinanced at higher interest rates. The current spending is unsustainable, as it already consumes a large portion of federal revenue. The cause of the spending problem is attributed to incompetency and perverse incentives, with no political reward for fiscal responsibility. The transcript suggests that spending cuts should be made in specific areas such as entitlements and military. For Social Security, raising the cap on taxable income and creating a pool for philanthropic contributions to support the most challenged elderly Americans are proposed. In terms of healthcare, the focus is on creating a national health insurance program that is portable and does not require a tax increase. The current fee-for-service model is seen as problematic, and a capitated model is suggested to incentivize providers to keep people out of the hospital. The military is also mentioned as an area where cuts could be made, but no specific details are provided.\n\nThe video transcript discusses the US fiscal situation, healthcare, defense spending, and restoring cross-party common ground.
