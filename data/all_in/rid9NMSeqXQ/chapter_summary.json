            "The Washington view on China is concerning. There is bipartisan consensus that China's trade deficit with the US should not have been allowed to accumulate. There is a push to rebalance the economy and bring production back to the US. In terms of defense on Taiwan, there is a difference of approaches, but the belief is to continue with strategic ambiguity and assist Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. The US is prepared to deter China from any coercive actions. The final policy is to have dialogue and communication with China, although it seems that China is not currently receptive to it."
