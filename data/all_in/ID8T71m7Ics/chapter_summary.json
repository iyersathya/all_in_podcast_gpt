They clarify that they are not rooting for Putin, but believe that his success is a result of the West's mistakes. Other predictions for the biggest political winner include an independent third party in the US and independent centrists. The breakdown of the two-party system is seen as a significant and long-lasting change in American politics."

            "The biggest business winner of 2024 is predicted to be the American natural gas industry, which had a successful year in 2023. The commodities market is also expected to see a boom in 2024 due to underinvestment and rising interest rates. Another potential winner is the bootstrapped profitable startup, as it will be cheaper to copy existing businesses in 2024. The Anduril company's Roadrunner product, a drone interceptor, is also predicted to be a big winner due to its cost-effectiveness compared to traditional air defense missiles. Training data owners, such as the New York Times, Reddit, and Twitter, are expected to benefit from the increasing value of language models and the need for training data. A market-based solution is proposed where licensing fees are paid to copyright holders for the use of their data. However, there are concerns about the feasibility and fairness of such a system.",
            "In the video transcript, the speaker discusses the concept of software companies and their gross margins. They mention that software companies typically have a gross margin of 30%, despite the idea that 50% of their costs of goods sold (COGs) are not related to software. The speaker also compares the limited scope of content in platforms like Spotify and Netflix, where the value can be easily ascribed to specific songs or shows. They mention the issue of proprietary data and how it can be used in training models, but also highlight the possibility of creating filters to exclude storing such data. The speaker concludes by mentioning some business predictions for 2024, including Google search as a potential loser in terms of profitability and engagement, and white-collar workers without hard skills as potential losers in the e-commerce industry."

Austerity: The prediction of austerity did not come true as there was an increase in debt and consumer spending remained high.\n\n2.

Cell gene therapy: While it may not have become mainstream, there have been more approvals and progress in cell gene therapy, with the anticipation of a wave of therapies coming to market soon.\n\n4. Predictive models and AI-driven discovery: The progress seen in 2023 in predictive models and AI-driven discovery of novel molecules, materials, and production methods in biopharma and chemical engineering is expected to continue in 2024, leading to new products and reduced costs.\n\n5. Bitcoin mainstream adoption: The anticipation is that Bitcoin will see mainstream adoption with the approval of ETFs, making it a part of the traditional financial lexicon by the end of 2024.\n\n6. Advancements in AI: The exponential pace of advancement in AI is expected to continue, although specific breakthroughs are uncertain. These advancements will likely percolate down to the average consumer.\n\n7. Efficiency through AI and outsourcing: The trend of outsourcing work to other geographies is expected to increase, driven by the desire for efficiency and cost savings.
