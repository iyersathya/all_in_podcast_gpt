            "Vivek Ramaswamy is a conservative entrepreneur and former CEO of a biotech company who is running for president as a Republican. He is anti-woke, pro-life, anti-affirmative action, pro-free speech, and wants federal government term limits. He founded a biotech company called Royven, which is now a $10 billion public company. He stepped down as CEO after facing demands to make a statement on behalf of Black Lives Matter from his own employees. He chose to run for president instead of a Senate or congressional seat because he wants to address corporate political and ESG distractions.",
            "Vivek Ramaswamy discusses his background and experiences with corporate politics and ESG distractions. He believes that young people in America are hungry for purpose and meaning, but are starving for it due to the decay of social norms like family and religion. He argues that the rise of secular cults and wokeism is a symptom of this void and that an alternative vision is needed to combat it. He is running for US president with a platform that embraces American exceptionalism and the ideals that founded the country.",

Ramaswamy thinks that most of Trump's policies were good, but he disagrees with some of them. He also believes that the election was stolen in a data-driven way due to the suppression of information about the Hunter Biden laptop story. Ramaswamy does not defend Trump's behavior and would not have done what he did. He thinks that Trump did not incite violence on January 6th and that criminalizing bad judgments is a risk to the country's future.",

He believes that deputizing the military to fight wars that are deflection tactics for our own ailments at home has been a mistake. There is a division within the Republican Party on Ukraine, with the base opposing involvement in Ukraine while the establishment is obsessed with it. Ramaswamy thinks that the fixation on Ukraine is a knee-jerk militarism and a symptom of a Republican Party that still sometimes projects hard power through deterring the USSR. He is open-minded to the influence of the military industrial complex and donors.
