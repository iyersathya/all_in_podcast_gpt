By doing so, you can build a resume and position yourself for Ivy League applications. Even if you change your mind later on, the work you've done is not wasted and can still be marketed towards your new interests. It's better to start thinking about your career path early on because it becomes harder to change later in life. When it comes to clubs, it's better to pick a small number and commit to them fully."
