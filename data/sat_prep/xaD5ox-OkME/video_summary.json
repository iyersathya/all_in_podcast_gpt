    "summary": [
        "The video provides a comprehensive guide for high school students who aspire to attend T20 and Ivy League institutions. The key takeaway is to start early and choose a career path to build a strong application. By actively pursuing different fields, students can understand their interests and build a resume that positions them for success. The video recommends getting involved in clubs that align with career goals and have opportunities for competition, as well as shadowing, interning, and volunteering to gain exposure to different fields. Sophomore year is a pivotal time to take on leadership roles and build up extracurriculars before junior year gets too busy. The video emphasizes the importance of SAT/ACT prep and creating a unique application, with a focus on academics and extracurricular activities in sophomore year and maintaining leadership positions in chosen clubs and excelling in academics in junior year. The final step is to start college applications in the second semester of junior year, focus on personal statements and supplemental essays during the summer, and finish submitting applications by the end of summer to reduce stress during senior year. By following a consistent blueprint and putting in the work, students can trust the process and increase their chances of Ivy League admission."
