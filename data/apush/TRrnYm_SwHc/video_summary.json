        "In this informative video, Steve Heimler delves into the reasons behind European exploration of the Americas and the impact it had on the world. The Europeans were in search of a water-based trade route to Asia, as the land-based routes were controlled by Muslims. Portugal established a trading post empire along the African coast and eventually dominated the lucrative Indian Ocean trade. Spain also entered the game, with the added motive of spreading Christianity. Christopher Columbus set sail west across the Atlantic to find a route to Asia, but instead discovered the Caribbean, which set off a chain of events known as the Columbian Exchange. Isabella and Ferdinand, the monarchs of Spain, funded Columbus' voyage and also established the Spanish Inquisition, which led to the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain. The impact of European exploration of the Americas was profound and far-reaching, changing the world in ways that are still felt today."
