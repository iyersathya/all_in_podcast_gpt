            "In this video, Steve Heimler discusses why European states started exploring the Americas and what happened when they finally did. The Europeans wanted to find a water-based route to Asia for trade, as the land-based routes were largely controlled by Muslims. Portugal established a trading post empire along the African coast and eventually found their way to dominance in the lucrative Indian Ocean trade. Spain also got involved in the game, with an additional motive of spreading Christianity. Christopher Columbus set sail west across the Atlantic to find a route to Asia, but instead discovered the Caribbean. This discovery set off a process that would change the world in drastic ways in something that became known as the Columbian Exchange."
