    "Steve Heimler": [
        "Steve Heimler's video discusses the reasons behind European exploration of the Americas, which was primarily driven by the desire for luxury goods from Asia. Portugal was the first to establish a water-based route to Asia, dominating the Indian Ocean trade, while Spain got involved with the additional motive of spreading Christianity. Christopher Columbus, sponsored by Ferdinand and Isabella, discovered the Caribbean and South America, leading to the Columbian Exchange, which had a significant impact on the world."
