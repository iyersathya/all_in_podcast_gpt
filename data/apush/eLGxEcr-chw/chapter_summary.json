            "The Columbian Exchange was the transfer of food, animals, minerals, people, and diseases between Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The exchange fundamentally transformed the societies, economies, and environments of all three continents. Disease, most notably smallpox, ravaged the native peoples of the Americas, while high-yielding nutritious foods like maize and tomatoes and potatoes and cacao were introduced to Europe. The Europeans introduced horses and pigs and cattle and chickens to the Americas, which transformed the diet of Native Americans, and horses revolutionized farming and warfare. The transfer of enslaved Africans to the Americas was significant, and they were sold into bondage to the highest bidder. The Spanish colonization effort was driven by the state, and specifically its mercantilist economic policies."
