    "Steve Heimler": [
        "Steve Heimler's video on Unit 1 of the AP US History curriculum delves into the impact of Spanish colonialism on the culture of the Americas. He explains how the mission system was used to convert Native Americans to Christianity, but the differences in worldview between the Spanish and the natives led to misunderstandings and resistance. He also discusses the Pueblo revolts, where the Pueblo people rose up against Spanish colonizers and burned their churches to the ground. Heimler highlights the arguments made by Bartolome de las Casas, a priest who defended the dignity of the Indians and argued against the encomienda system, but suggested that Africans replace natives in forced labor."
