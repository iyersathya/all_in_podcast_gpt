        "Steve Heimler's video focuses on the diversity of Native American cultures in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans. He highlights the complex political systems, religions, and cultivation of maize of the Aztecs, Maya, and Inca civilizations in Central and South America. He also discusses the various cultures in North America, including sedentary Pueblo farmers, nomadic hunter-gatherers, fishing villages, and larger societies in the Mississippi River Valley and Northeast. Heimler offers an APUSH review packet for students seeking help in their class and exam preparation."
