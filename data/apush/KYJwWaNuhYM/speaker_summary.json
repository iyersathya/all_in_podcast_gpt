        "Steve Heimler has developed a tool called Heimler's History Video Note Guides for AP World, AP US, AP Euro, and AP Government to assist students in actively engaging with his videos and achieving an A in their classes. The note guides include a learning objective, blanks to fill in, and a box to summarize the learning up to that point, allowing students to write the concepts in their own words and begin to internalize them. The note guides are ideal for assisting students in achieving an A in their class, while the review pack is particularly useful for reviewing and practicing everything they need to know for their class exams and the national exam in May."
