        "question": "How are the note guides different from Steve Heimler's review pack",
        "answer": "The note guides are best for helping students get an A in their class because they are more bite-sized and focus mainly on the content of the course. The review pack, on the other hand, is particularly helpful for reviewing and practicing everything students need to know for their class exams and the national exam in May. Both tools are designed to help students get an A in their class and a 5 on their exam in May",
