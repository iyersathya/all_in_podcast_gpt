        "Steve Heimler, an AP History and AP Government teacher, has created YouTube videos to help students succeed in their classes. However, he emphasizes that true learning requires more than just watching videos. To actively engage with the material and improve their understanding, Heimler has created note guides for his history videos. These note guides include a learning objective, fill-in-the-blank sections, and a summary box. They are designed to help students get an A in class. Heimler also offers a review pack for students to practice and review everything they need to know for class exams and the national exam in May. The first two units are free for all classes. Heimler highly recommends his note guides and review pack for students looking to succeed in their AP History and AP Government classes."
