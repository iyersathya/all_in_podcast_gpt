    "Steve Heimler": [
        "Steve Heimler's overview of Unit 1 of the AP US History curriculum highlights the diversity of Native American cultures and societies before and after the arrival of Europeans. He also discusses the reasons for European exploration and colonization, including the desire for luxury goods from Asia and the development of new maritime technology. The Spanish colonization of the Americas is also discussed, including the introduction of the encomienda system and the casta system, which categorized people based on their racial ancestry. Bartolome de las Casas opposed this thinking and persuaded the king to pass laws ending the slavery of the natives, but the wealthy nobles got the laws repealed."
