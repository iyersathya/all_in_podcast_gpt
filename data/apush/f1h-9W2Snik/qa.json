        "question": "What was the reason for the Spanish importing African people to replace the Native Americans as slaves",
        "answer": "The reason for the Spanish importing African people to replace the Native Americans as slaves was because the natives were dying from European diseases and they knew the land way better than the Spaniards did, and therefore there was the constant problem of natives escaping their slavery never to be found. The Africans had better immunity than the Native Americans AND they knew the land less than the Spaniards did",
